when it comes to my fiscal health - after a very limited yet strongly aligned research, I was able to narrow down to this:

> _keep expenses sane, kill bad debt, stay liquid, invest globally with low-cost indexes, avoid hype, let your wealth come from building equity in real things, not trading noise._

## core personal finance principles

i found this very interesting read, which talks about how money affects our happiness and its curve on they affect each other.
see ([https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/](https://80000hours.org/articles/money-and-happiness/))
- moment-to-moment "happiness" increases with money until you’re making ~$70-80k
- income reduces stress up to a “comfortable” baseline, after which **life satisfaction still increases**, even if day-to-day happiness plateaus.

a [study](https://www.pnas.org/doi/full/10.1073/pnas.1011492107) by Nobel prize winners Daniel Kahneman and Angus Deaton done w Americans (first world country)
- positive affect – “were you happy yesterday?”
- low stress – “did you feel stressed yesterday?”
- not blue – “did you feel sad yesterday?”
- ladder – “how satisfied are you with your life overall?”

result:

<Image src={happinessCurve} alt="happiness curve" className="my-8 rounded-xl" />

key takeaway from the graph:
"extra income had _no_ relationship with how happy, sad and stressed people felt after a point on the curve"
(note: study was done in 2010 - so adjust for inflation but inference stays the same - human psychology hadn't changed)

but also not all studies found money to not have impact on happiness - in a different studies that spanned its research across varying countries - the money impact inflection point either diminished or just shifted forward (meaning poorer countries associate happiness with money more)

**what do we learn from that research?**
you take the best opportunities to invest in your happiness first, so as you get more money, it becomes harder and harder to buy more happiness

## best uses of money
in relation to the happiness curve
1. buy time (delegation, convenience)
2. experiences over possessions
3. giving (strong psychological ROI)
this applies strongly to my **high-output, high-variance career**.
    
# general infered rules for pf from my research
1. **budgeting and cash reserves**
   - keep 3-6 months of expenses in liquid cash (savings + liquid mutual fund)
   - as income grows, adjust savings rate before lifestyle expenses creep in
2. **housing rent / EMIs**
   - rent can take upto ≤30% of income (consider home EMIs within this bracket as well)
     - NOTE: a house you live in is **not** an investment - so don't think that going with home loan EMIs is a better option compared to renting as a bias
   - treat it as a lifestyle decision, not an investment, **unless**:
     - you plan to stay ≥ 7 years
     - EMI ≤ 25% of net income
     - still invest aggressively
     - career is geographically stable
3. **debt priority framework**
   - kill high interest debt first (credit cards, loans etc)
   - can ignore low interest debts if returns elsewhere are high sourced from this
4. **investing philosophy**
   - focus on passive > active
   - index first mindset
   - mental model: earning + building over stock picking
   - **invest aggressively until your income stream is mostly passive.** - rich dad, poor dad
5. **dollar cost averaging (DCA)**
   - statistically lump sum wins most of the time
   - DCA is fine, as it helps staying emotionally invested
6. **portfolio construction**
   - simplify portfolio, lower cost, periodic rebalancing, no tinkering
   - can also have half yearly rebalancing but also look into mechanical threshold based rebalancing
     - define target allocation: eg. equity: 70%, debt: 25%, gold: 5% - if there is a drift of ±5-10% then rebalance
     - check twice a year, rebalance once a year (if needed), prefer absolute threshold deviance for early career
   - think of equity indexes, debt funds, gold funds
   - expense ratios on the funds matter more than we think (fee taken by the fund annually)
   - be careful with recency bias
7. **geographic diversification**
   - single country portfolio is an actual risk to consider
   - think global equities + emerging markets + some India tilt
   - can think of this when income crosses 80K USD
8. **risk tolerance > optimization**
   - consistency beats cleverness
9. **gold**
   - gold is NOT a growth asset
   - it's a hedge against systemic risk
   - 5% direct gold allocation is reasonable
   - anything beyond can be with ETFs, sovereign bonds
   - can be extended based on cultural reasons (ornamentals)
10. **market timings**
    - boring, hated sectors often outperform hype.
    - “next revolution” is often overpriced (ai, crypto, etc)
11. **income growth on year**
    - baseline stable income professional: 10–15% YoY - beats inflation and lifestyle creeps
    - founder / high variance path: 
      - think in step functions
      - flat or modest growth for couple years atleast
      - 30-100% jumps when: equity crystallizes, consulting rates reset, a product starts paying, a role upgrade happens
    - if you’re not seeing a **meaningful income reset every ~24 months**, something’s off
    - don’t force a clean CAGR on a chaotic career. force _shots on goal_.
12. **buying a car**
    - a car is a pure consumption asset. buy it consiously
    - hard constraints:
      - total car cost ≤ 6–12 months of net income, if higher → lifestyle inflation
      - down payment ≥ 30–40%; avoid heavy leverage on any depreciating asset
      - loan tenure ≤ 4 years
      - EMI ≤ 10–12% of net monthly income
13. **misc**
    - social proof is a dangerous drug (“everyone thinks housing only goes up.”)
