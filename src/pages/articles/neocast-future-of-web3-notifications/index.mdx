so, web3 communication is broken. users are constantly refreshing interfaces, checking explorers, and missing critical updates. the infrastructure is there—on-chain events are firing—but the connection to the real world is missing.

enter **neocast**. bridging the gap between the chain and your inbox.

## the problem

traditional web apps have this solved. you get a slack ping when a deployment finishes. you get an email when someone replies to you. but in web3? silence.

common scenarios:
- defi traders glue themselves to screens to watch positions.
- nft creators manually refreshing opensea.
- dao votes passing while you sleep.
- devs blindly hoping their contracts are behaving.

the data is public. the access is painful. neocast fixes this.

## what is neocast?

think zapier for blockchain. it’s a communication network that listens to smart contracts and triggers real-world actions. discord webhooks, emails, api calls. if it happens on-chain, you know about it off-chain. instantly.

## the architecture

simple concept, powerful execution:

`event` -> `neocast` -> `action`

<Image src={architectureImage} alt="NeoCast Platform Architecture" className="my-8 rounded-xl" />

we monitor the network nodes directly. no polling. no delays. when a block is finalized, the notification is already on its way.

## the features

**multi-chain native.**
started with neo n3, expanded to evm. ethereum, polygon, bsc. doesn't matter where you build, we listen.

**real-time detection.**
websockets over http polling. speed matters. if a liquidation is happening, you need to know now, not in 5 minutes.

**flexible actions.**
- discord for the community.
- email for the suits.
- webhooks for the devs.
- custom api calls for the wild cards.

## visual builder

we built a drag-and-drop workflow builder. because not everyone wants to write scripts to get a notification.

1. pick your contract.
2. pick your event.
3. pick your destination.
4. deploy.

## use cases

**defi monitoring**
```javascript
// liquidity alerts straightforward
const alert = {
  trigger: 'LiquidityAdded',
  action: 'sendEmail',
  message: 'heads up: liquidity changed. new balance: {newBalance}'
};
```

**nft drops**
discord blows up the second a mint happens. automated hype generation.

**dao governance**
no more "i didn't know there was a vote". push notifications for new proposals. transparency enforced by code.

## tech deep dive

integration is standard solidity events. nothing proprietary to install on your contract.

```solidity
// just emit standard events
event LiquidityAdded(address user, uint256 amount);

function addLiquidity(uint256 amount) external {
    // logic...
    emit LiquidityAdded(msg.sender, amount);
}
```

we catch that emit, parse the abi, and hydrate a template:

```json
{
  "template": "yo {{user}}, you just added {{amount}} tokens",
  "variables": { "user": "{user}", "amount": "{amount}" }
}
```

## security

non-custodial. we don't touch keys. we don't touch funds. we just read public data and shout about it. decentralized nodes for redundancy. rate limiting to prevent spam.

## partnerships

big names backing the vision.
- **neo foundation**: native n3 support.
- **okx**: wallet integration.
- **axlabs**: tooling partners.

## what's next

neocast isn't just a notification tool. it's the notification layer. infrastructure for the next wave of dapps.

users shouldn't have to seek information. it should come to them. improved ux, better developer tools, engaged communities.

the future is connected. neocast is the bridge.
