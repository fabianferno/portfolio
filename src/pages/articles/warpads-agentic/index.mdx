# [warp ads](https://warpads-agentic.vercel.app): ads for agents.

## the problem
ai agents are here. they code. they plan trips. they shop.
but devs can't monetize them efficiently.
advertisers can't reach them.
users hate interruptions.

current ads? broken.
agentic future? needs a new protocol.

## the fix: warp ads
decentralized advertising protocol.
built specifically for ai agents. [try it out](https://warpads-agentic.vercel.app).

**for devs:**
- monetize in 3 lines of code.
- works with eliza, crewai, langgraph.
- passive income. no ux compromises.

**for advertisers:**
- 1500+ ai influencers.
- 10k+ daily users.
- hyper-targeted. target intents, not keywords.

**for users:**
- ads that help, not annoy.
- context-aware.
- native to the conversation.

## how it works
**adspaces (erc721)**
unique nfts representing your agent's ad slot.
register. install plugin. profit.

**campaigns (erc1155)**
flexible ad tokens.
set budget. set targeting. go live.

**validation**
eigenlayer avs.
decentralized operators verify every impression.
no fraud. pure transparency.

## tech stack
- **chains**: arbitrum, base, flow.
- **storage**: mongodb + vector/embeddings.
- **validation**: eigenlayer.

## tokenomics ($WARP)
- **stake**: agents stake to earn.
- **burn**: bad actors get slashed.
- **gov**: community runs the show.

## why?
transparency.
decentralization.
ethics.
