hello world. let’s talk nfts.

what are they? non fungible tokens.

means it’s unique. can’t replace it.
bitcoin is fungible. trade one for another, you have the same thing.

a rare trading card? non-fungible. trade it, you have something completely different. mona lisa? non-fungible. you get the idea.

technically: tokens stored on decentralized networks. ethereum. solana. blockchains.

but why invest? is there intrinsic value?

<Image src={pirate} alt="" />

it’s about utility.
tickets that kill scalping.
token gating access.
royalties for authors forever.
advertising is changing. nfts are the key.

here’s how. metaverses.
create a digital version of yourself. your avatar.
walk into a digital wine shop. talk to an avatar expert. order wine. get it shipped to your physical home.

that’s the metaverse. persistent. interoperable. intersection of digital and physical.

epiphany time.
co-founder and i were at a web3 meetup. in the "voxelverse".
flying around. casually.

voxelverse - wip meetup

saw a billboard.
people leasing ad space in the metaverse. doing it right now.
but it goes deeper.

how i see it:
irl, you lease a billboard on a highway. time-bound.
web3? nfts.

every billboard is an nft.
mint it. lease it.
burn it when the campaign ends.
program royalties. owner of the space gets paid automatically. space moves to the highest bidder.
endless possibilities.

analytics is key.
we have the entire blockchain’s data.
nftconomy is building the toolkit for this. analytics driven decisions.

bear market? doesn't matter. #BUIDLERS are shipping.

web3. metaverse. utility. decentralized. new internet.
that’s what we stand for.
