export default (props) => <ArticleLayout meta={meta} {...props} />

so, cloka wasn't supposed to be this. started back in march 2025 like a typical side quest. clothing brand. simple storefront. sell some hoodies, vibe out. standard stack: next.js, tailwind, stripe.

but then the community happened. people weren't just buying clothes. they were running. they wanted to connect. saw the signal, decided to pivot. hard.

## the pivot

clothing brand -> run club -> social health tech. sounds crazy on paper but the git logs don't lie. moved from products to events, check-ins, and arcs. realized the value wasn't the fabric, it was the sweat.

## the stack

kept it simple to move fast. core:

- next.js 15 (app router is good actually)
- typescript (sanity checks)
- tailwind (speed)
- mongodb + mongoose (flexible schema for a pivoting brain)

infrastructure:

- vercel (hosting, blob for images)
- github actions (ci/cd)

## feature: arcs

this is the social layer. wanted something ephemeral but sticky. built "arcs". think of it like a seasonal campaign for your health. you join an arc, you check in, you track progress. leveraged html-to-image for those shareable cards you see on twitter. make it look good, people will share it. simple growth loop.

## the strava integration

couldn't build a run club without the data. integrated strava oauth. now we pull:

- prs (5k, 10k, half marathon)
- streaks
- weekly distance

gamified it. you don't just run; you unlock achievements. the backend syncs this automatically. user connects once, we handle the refreshing tokens and data fetching in the background.

## handling scale (and images)

user generated content is heavy. check-in photos, profile pics, event galleries. dumped s3 for vercel blob. easier DX. implemented pwa features because runners have spotty signal. offline support via service workers. if you're on a trail, the app should still work.

## what's next

cloka is evolving. it’s not just a run club anymore. it’s becoming a social health protocol. building a mobile app now. more health integrations. more social graph features.

built with intent. shipped with speed. evolution is the only constant.

more soon. fabian.
