## Hello World!

Ever wondered how cool it would be to cause mayhem at your discord friend's house for fun?

> Me and **@joshuafrankle** were working on a discord bot this year. We came up with cringe fest bot that played "Funny Tamil Comedy" soundtracks on command. We've been continuously adding features. It kinda evolved in a way we didn't imagine. Now we use [mr.robot](https://github.com/fabianferno/mr.robot) for our server management, api-testing, wiki and more.

So, here it goes. I've been working with some micro-controllers lately and I thought why not bring in some IoT to the recipe. **#mightregretthisdecision**

Although it ended up heating up my micro-controller and almost made my house look possessed, it was still worth a shot.

I used NodeMCU 8266 - the go to micro-controller for any hobby engineers out there. Instead of going with embedded C for my programming my board, I tried MicroPython for a change and trust me - the best decision.

Moreover that gave me an headstart in integrating it with my discord bot which already written in discord.py - a python discord client library. WebREPL modules came in handy to upload the program to my board.

### Finally got everything set up and running in less than an hour.

I got my friends to turn on fans and switch off some lights. So here's the fun - the bot had access to a discord server with almost 300 members. Quite the party. Anybody on the internet could toggle my devices. My friends started playing with my house.

Sadly, [mr.robot](https://github.com/fabianferno/mr.robot) had to be put down. I took it offline then.

Meanwhile I'm working on more a secure way to for this discord integration. Will post my next update with regard to this security update.
