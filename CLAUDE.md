# Working in this app (built with October)

This project is built inside **October**, a spatial canvas where each app **screen/route shows up as its own node**. October discovers screens by scanning the route files on disk, so how you structure routes is exactly what the user sees on the canvas.

## One screen = one route file

Every screen is its own route segment under `app/` (or `src/app/`), with a default-exported component in `page.tsx`. The folder name *is* the route:
- `app/welcome/page.tsx` → `/welcome`, `app/sign-up/page.tsx` → `/sign-up`
- Use flat, lowercase, hyphenated segment names. Avoid deeply nested routes.
- Navigate between screens with `next/link` or `useRouter().push('/goals')`.

## When the user asks for a flow or multiple screens

Onboarding, a wizard, "a few screens", steps, a set of screens — **create one separate route file per screen.** Never put multiple screens inside a single component: no internal step/pager/carousel state standing in for separate screens, and no extra screen components exported from one file. One screen = one file = one route, so each shows up as its own node on the canvas.

## Dependencies

When you import a new package, add it to `package.json` in the same change (for Expo / React Native, run `npx expo install <pkg>` so it picks a compatible version and writes `package.json` for you). Anything missing from `package.json` disappears on a clean install and crashes the app.

## Working with other agents

If you're connected to October's bus (the october-bus MCP tools), you can bring on helper agents. Use `add_terminal` or `add_chat` without a target to share the current workspace's files; `checkoutId` or `joinTaskOf` selects an existing working location. Use `createWorkspace:{requestId,name,isolated:true}` for independent work in a separate workspace. Keep requestId stable on retry. Creation returns the child workspace, canvas and node references. Use `list_children`, `message_child`, `get_child_status` and `stop_child` for your children across workspaces; they reply with `message_parent`. Same-workspace agents retain ordinary connections and `message_peer`.
